## 🔁 Hardware Communication Flow  
STM32 handles:  
- Motor (speed control)  
- Servo (steering angle)  
- Sends data to Jetson Nano Orin via UART:  
  - Speed info  
  - Servo angle

Jetson Nano Orin handles:  
- Capturing map and street data using camera  
- Processing AI tasks  
- Interacting with STM32 via UART
